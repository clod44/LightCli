# LightCli
 simple command line interface graphics library thingy.. its for learning purposes.  
 
 ## What is this
 this is my first somewhat successful attempt to create something like library (i still dont know enough to work around these small things) that can be used to create a simple ascii powered graphical user interface. what i mean is it can just show boxes and text. thats all.
 
 ## Features
 - very abstract classes
 - custom ascii resolution(main window dimensions)
 - basic rectangle support 
   - few different border styles (easy to add more)
   - filling styles(easy to add more). supports no filling too (transparent)
 - crude textbox support
   - `"'\` etc breaks it
   - auto line break
   - 3 different horizontal aligning ways
   - padding from rectangle that applies to textbox. textbox is a part of rectangle thingy (i call the whole thing CONTENT).
   - (tbh i might call it CONTENT or rectangle or window or idk not sure yet about the terminology)  
## How to use it
just copy paste the code if you want. that would work ig. 

## Showcase
You might be saying "damn thats crazy". but hear me out. since these are very abstract simple stuff.. i can create custom boilerplate classes to create fancy stuff made by these simple _primitives_









 
 ##### notes: 
 this is a monodevelop project folder. i dont know much about C languages. this was my practice project.  
 imagine coding 15 hours in 2 days to learn C# and clis instead of watching a hour long tutorial.
